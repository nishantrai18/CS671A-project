Online algorithm

Create a new cluster (sense) for a word type with probability proportional to the distance of its context to the nearest cluster (sense), try the discrete model too.

word w ∈ W is associated with sense vectors, context clusters and a global vector vg (w), points to be noted are as follows,
  	- vector representation of the context is the average of its context words’ vectors
	- Initially, the words do not have sense vectors and context clusters. 
	- We create the first sense vector and context cluster for each word on its first occurrence in the training data.

New context cluster and a sense vector are created online when the word is observed with a context where the similarity between the vector representation of the context with every existing cluster center of the word is less than λ,

For each word, perform the simple update to increase the clusters.



Pseudo Code:

Hash word vectors, file input			(A)

for every word in set:
	Intialise cluster to 0. With null sense vectors.

for every word in set:
	
	select r_t  = context window length (Randomly or gaussian distribution)
	Calculate context vectors 																(B)

	let k be the current number of contexts associated
	for all current clusters:
		check the distance
		Find the cluster with max similarity (Possible similarity measures include, glob sim, AvgSim, etc)						
	If the distance is greater than a specified quantity then create a new cluster. (probability based creation could be a good option)
	If we need to create a new cluster, then we initialise the cluster's center as the context vector itself
	The sense vector "should" be the average of all the context vectors associated with the clusters 															(C)
