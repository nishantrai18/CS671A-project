Online algorithm

Create a new cluster (sense) for a word type with probability proportional to the distance of its context to the nearest cluster (sense).
Try the discrete model too.


word w ∈ W is associated with sense vectors, context clusters and a global vector vg (w), point s to be noted are as follows,
vector representation of the context is the average of its context words’ vectors



Initially, the words do not have sense vectors and context clusters. We create the first sense vector and context cluster for each word on its first occurrence in the training data.
new context cluster and a sense vector are created online when the word is observed with a context where the similarity between the vector representation of the context with every existing cluster center of the word is less than λ,

For each word, perform a simple update..
